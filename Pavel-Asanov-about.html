        <h1>About Pavel Asanov</h1>
        <p>Pavel Asanov is a business executive, repeat entrepreneur, and startup mentor who has built, scaled and exited multiple early-stage and growth-stage ventures. With more than two decades of expertise in product development, go-to-market, and business operations, Pavel is a trusted resource for companies in pre- and post-MVP phases that are looking to bring their products to market, expand into new geographies or segments, or accelerate their pace of innovation.</p>
        <p> Currently, Pavel is the Director of Business Operations at Excel Security Corp., a New York-based provider of security services, including personnel security, investigation and background checks, training and emergency response, access control, visitor management, and surveillance installation. In this capacity, he works directly with the company’s executives to define and operationalize the long-term business strategy and growth roadmap.</p>
        <p>Prior to his current role, Pavel was the Chief Operating Officer of Finta Inc., a rapid-growth fintech company that was a blockchain-based equity management platform at the time. As COO, Pavel steered product development for the bootstrapped venture alongside a team of 5 that successfully launched Finta’s services. Most notably, he led the development of a proof-of-concept token for managing a capitalization table on an Ethereum blockchain through changes to ERC-20. He also headed the product’s go-to-market strategy to enter new markets successfully, structure key business partnerships, and guide all aspects of regulatory compliance to secure necessary permissions and approvals.</p>
        <p> Earlier in his career, Pavel co-founded an entrepreneurial venture named Sound Facets LLC – a fully licensed burglar alarm security company that serviced a portfolio of both residential and commercial customers. Serving as Managing Partner from the company’s inception to his exit in 2018, he evolved the venture from the ground up to $5M in ARR. This growth was achieved through a mix of both organic initiatives, including new market entry and service expansion, as well as partnerships with leading players, including ADI, Alarm.com, and Telguard. </p>
        <p>Pavel initiated his career as an entrepreneur in Uzbekistan with the launch of Mikro-tech. As a personal computer integration and distribution company, Mikro-tech became a pioneering channel partner for Intel within the region. After working at Mikro-tech for 3 years, Pavel immigrated to the USA.</p>
        <p>Outside of his professional endeavors, Pavel is a Start-up Mentor with the Macquarie University Incubator and Founder Institute Incubator, where he works with promising founders to refine their ideas and shape viable strategies for product development and go-to-market. Over the course of a decade, Pavel has helped 200+ businesses successfully launch products across multiple industries and geographies.

        <p> Pavel is a published researcher and has presented a poster at the International Society for Autism Research entitled “Connecting through Kinect: A Participatory Approach to Designing a Collaborative Emotion Recognition Game with and for Autistic Individuals.”</p>
